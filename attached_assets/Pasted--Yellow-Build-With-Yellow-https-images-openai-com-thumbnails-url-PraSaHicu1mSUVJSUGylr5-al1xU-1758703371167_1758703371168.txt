### üîß Step 1: Set Up Your Development Environment

1. **Install the Yellow SDK**:
   Begin by installing the Yellow SDK package using npm or yarn:

   ```bash
   npm install @yellow-network/sdk
   ```

2. **Import the SDK**:
   In your application, import the SDK to initialize and interact with Yellow Network:

   ```javascript
   import { YellowSDK } from '@yellow-network/sdk';
   ```

3. **Initialize the SDK**:
   Create an instance of the SDK with your API key and desired blockchain environment:

   ```javascript
   const yellow = new YellowSDK({
     apiKey: process.env.YELLOW_API_KEY,
     environment: 'mainnet', // or 'testnet'
     defaultChain: 'ethereum',
   });
   ```

   This setup allows your application to interact with Yellow Network's decentralized infrastructure.

### ‚öôÔ∏è Step 2: Implement Core Functionalities

#### 1. **Policy Analysis and Risk Assessment**

* **OCR and AI Analysis**:
  Utilize your existing OCR and AI models to extract and analyze policy data.

* **Smart Contract Interaction**:
  Integrate with Yellow Network's smart contracts to verify policy terms and conditions on-chain.

#### 2. **Claims Management**

* **Session Creation**:
  Establish a trading session for claim processing:

```javascript
  const session = await yellow.trading.createSession({
    address: userAddress,
    chains: ['ethereum', 'polygon', 'bsc'],
  });
```

* **Claim Submission**:
  Use the session to submit claims:

```javascript
  const result = await session.swap({
    fromToken: 'USDC',
    toToken: 'WETH',
    amount: '1000',
    fromChain: 'polygon',
    toChain: 'ethereum',
    slippage: 0.5,
  });
```

This approach ensures that claims are processed efficiently and securely.

#### 3. **Document Storage and Security**

* **Decentralized Storage**:
  Store policy documents securely using IPFS integration, ensuring data integrity and privacy.

* **Blockchain Integration**:
  Connect with MetaMask for user authentication and transaction signing, leveraging blockchain's security features.

### üìà Step 3: Testing and Deployment

1. **Testing**:

   * Use Jest or a similar testing framework to write unit and integration tests for your application.
   * Mock Yellow SDK interactions to simulate real-world scenarios.

2. **Deployment**:

   * Deploy your application on platforms like Vercel or Netlify for front-end, and AWS or Heroku for back-end services.
   * Ensure that all environment variables, such as `YELLOW_API_KEY`, are securely managed.

### üí° Additional Resources

* **Yellow SDK Documentation**: Access comprehensive guides and API references to deepen your integration.
* **Yellow Network Overview**: Understand the underlying architecture and features of Yellow Network.
* **Developer Community**: Join forums and groups to collaborate and seek support from fellow developers.
