Good — let’s break down **how to get & build the “One-Click Policy Comparison” module** for ClaimMate.

---

## **Step 1 — Where to Get Policy Data**

You need a **dataset of Indian insurance products** with key fields (coverage, exclusions, waiting periods, claim settlement ratio, premiums).
Ways to get it:

1. **IRDAI Public Data** (Free & Legal)

   * IRDAI publishes PDF circulars on health & life insurance products.
   * You can scrape / parse these into structured JSON.
     Example: “List of Approved Health Insurance Products – IRDAI site.”

2. **Aggregator APIs** (Fast, paid / partnership route)

   * Companies like **PolicyBazaar, Coverfox, Ditto API, InsuranceDekho** provide APIs for comparisons.
   * For MVP, you don’t need full tie-up — scrape their *public product comparison tables* (but careful for competition rules).

3. **Manual Dataset (MVP-friendly)**

   * Start with **10–15 popular policies** (e.g., HDFC Ergo, ICICI Lombard, Star Health).
   * Store in your DB like this:

     ```json
     {
       "policy_name": "Star Health Family Optima",
       "insurer": "Star Health",
       "coverage": "₹10 Lakh",
       "waiting_period": "3 years",
       "copay": "10%",
       "premium": "₹14,000/yr",
       "claim_settlement_ratio": "92%"
     }
     ```

---

## **Step 2 — Backend Setup**

1. Create a **Policy table** in PostgreSQL.
2. Add fields: `policy_name, insurer, coverage, premium, exclusions, waiting_period, settlement_ratio`.
3. Write an API in **FastAPI**:

   * `GET /compare/{policy_id}` → returns list of similar policies sorted by coverage & risk score.

Pseudo-code:

```python
@app.get("/compare/{policy_id}")
def compare_policy(policy_id: int):
    current = db.get_policy(policy_id)
    # Find policies with similar coverage but higher claim ratio or fewer exclusions
    alternatives = db.query("""
        SELECT * FROM policies 
        WHERE coverage >= %s
        ORDER BY claim_settlement_ratio DESC
        LIMIT 5
    """, [current.coverage])
    return {"current": current, "alternatives": alternatives}
```

## **Step 3 — Frontend UI (Next.js + Tailwind)**

Build a **comparison table UI**:

| Feature                | Current Policy | Alternative 1 | Alternative 2 |
| ---------------------- | -------------- | ------------- | ------------- |
| Coverage               | ₹5 L           | ₹10 L         | ₹10 L         |
| Premium                | ₹12,000        | ₹14,000       | ₹13,500       |
| Claim Settlement Ratio | 82%            | 94%           | 96%           |
| Waiting Period         | 3 years        | 2 years       | 2 years       |
| Co-Pay                 | 20%            | 10%           | 0%            |

**Highlight better values in green** and worse in red.
Add a CTA: **“Learn More →”** (link to official insurer site).

Tailwind example for highlighting:

```jsx
<td className="text-green-600 font-semibold">94%</td>
<td className="text-red-600">20%</td>
```

## **Step 4 — Graphics / Killer UX**

* Add a **radar chart** (ApexCharts) to visually compare current vs alternative.
* Example axes: Coverage, Premium, Claim Ratio, Flexibility.
* Use **Framer Motion** so table rows “slide in” when analysis is ready.
* Show a **“Switch & Save” badge** if alternatives give more coverage at same/lower premium.

---

## **Step 5 — MVP Strategy**

* Start with a **small curated dataset (10–20 policies)** → demo-ready in 1–2 weeks.
* Later, expand with **scraping / aggregator APIs**.
* Judges don’t need 500 policies — they just need to **see the killer idea working**.

---

🔥 This module makes ClaimMate **proactive, not just diagnostic**:

* You tell users “Here’s what’s wrong.”
* AND show “Here’s a better, safer option.”

Do you want me to create a **ready-made JSON dataset of 10–15 real Indian health policies** (with coverage, premium, exclusions, claim ratios) so you can plug it into your MVP right away?
